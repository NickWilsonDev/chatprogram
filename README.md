chatprogram
===========

This is both a chat client and server that supports multiple users. Also the repository includes a basic gui form of 
the client.
This was a school project for our networking course.
  Any functional form of a gui for the client could gain some extra credit points.

If all files are compiled then the program can be run by 
java MultiuserChatServerDriver <port #>
java MultiuserChatClientDriver <host name ex localhost> <port #> <username>
type "/quit" to sign off of client and ctr c to shutdown the server
type "/help" to show list of availible commands
